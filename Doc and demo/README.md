# Project Title : "iRevolution: A Data-driven Exploration of Apple’s iPhone Impact in India using Tableau.”


"iRevolution: A Data-driven Exploration of Apple’s iPhone Impact in India using Tableau is a data analytics project that uncovers the performance, popularity, and consumer preferences surrounding Apple’s iPhones in the Indian market. Using a combination of Python for data cleaning, IBM DB2 for database storage, Tableau for interactive dashboards, and Flask for web integration, the project delivers meaningful insights into model-wise pricing trends, RAM-based preferences, and customer ratings. The visual dashboards highlight how specific models like the iPhone SE and XR dominate sales due to their balanced pricing and features, while also revealing that most users prefer 4 GB RAM variants. By turning raw data into clear, actionable visuals, this project helps stakeholders understand how Apple maintains its premium position in a highly competitive and price-sensitive market like India. Future improvements include integrating real-time social media sentiment analysis, predictive modeling, and comparative analysis with other smartphone brands."
